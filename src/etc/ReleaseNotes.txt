Version 1.1.0
-------------

We are very proud of this release so we would like to share some details with
you about new features, improvements and bug fixes.

A complete list of bug fixes and new features is available here:
http://dev.powerfolder.com/projects/powerfolder/query?status=closed&milestone=PowerFolder+1.1.0


Version 1.0.2
-------------

- Exclude files or folders from the synchronization.
  Just mark files by right click and choose "Add file to Ignore" or set a
  pattern like "images/*.bak" per folder (use the settings tab at the folder).

- Drastically improved LAN transfer speed!
  PowerFolder now also uploads more files simultaneous to one user to improve
  the transmission speed of small files. We improved LAN transfers further by
  tuning low level network settings and speeded up disk access.
  
- Reduced CPU and memory usage!
  We did a lot to reduce the load on your system resources so we use
  less memory and CPU, so hopefully you won't notice that PowerFolder is
  running, just that all your files are synchronized.
  
- Better Up- and Download limit control.
  A download limit is available now. Improved "silent" mode: PowerFolder stops
  scanning your hard disk for new files (as in previous versions) and now limits
  your upload/download to a low percentage of your set limits.
  
- More backups of your files: If PowerFolder downloads a newer version of a file
  (2nd version), the old file (1st version) is copied to the PowerFolder
  recycle bin, so you can restore it. On windows only: If PowerFolder downloads
  a 3rd version of a file the 1st version is moved to the system recycle bin,
  and the 2nd is moved to the PowerFolder recycle bin.
  
- We changed how PowerFolder creates shortcuts on your desktop.
  PowerFolder not longer recreates them if your remove them. This was
  potentially annoying. Now you can specify to create a shortcut if the 
  folder is joined or from the context menu of a folder.

- There are numerous improvements to the user interface to name a few:
  ETA, we now estimate how long it will take to synchronize your folder.
  Up/download speed in the status bar.
  More settings to control in the preferences
  (we have an advanced tab there for those who like to control even more).

- We did a lot too reduce the "traffic overhead". This saves bandwidth for the
  actual file transfers.
